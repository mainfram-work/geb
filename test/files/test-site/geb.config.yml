# Geb Configuration File
# =======================
#
# This is a sample configuration file for the geb command line tool.
# You pretty much don't have to specify anything in this file, unless you want to 
# customize the site. The default values are good enough for most sites.
#
# EVEN IF YOU DON"T SPECIFY ANYTHING IN THIS FILE, THIS CONFIG FILE MUST EXIST
# AT THE ROOT OF THE SITE DIRECTORY.  OTHERWISE, THE GEB COMMANDS WILL NOT WORK.
# IT CAN BE EMPTY, BUT IT MUST EXIST. GEB DEMANDS IT.
#
# However, remote_uri and remote_path are required if you want to use 
# the geb remote and upload commands. If you plan to upload the site on your own then
# you don't need to specify these values.
#

# Name of the site. 
# If not specified, the default is the name of the directory where the site is located.
# Just for display purposes.
#site_name: "My Site"

# The remote_uri is the SSH URI of the remote server that you are deploying to.
# Geb remote and upload commands will use this URI to connect to the server.
# If you don't specify a remote_uri, geb remote and upload commands will not work.
# Typical format is username@server
remote_uri: "user@server.com"

# The remote_path is the path on the remote server where the site is located.
# If you don't specify a remote_path, upload commands will not work.
remote_path: "/home/user/public_html"

# Set the local web server port that the site will run on.
# Geb server command will use this port to start the local web server
# If you don't specify a port, geb server command auto selects a port
local_port: 4000

# Specifies the output directory, this directory will be used to store the output of
# the build and release commands. 
# the output directory is relative to the site directory.
# The default value is "output"
#output_dir: "output"

# Specifies the assets directory, this directory will be used to store the assets.
# The assets directory is relative to the site directory.
# The default value is "assets"
#assets_dir: "assets"

# Specifies the page extensions that are used in the site. This can be any text file extension.
# Default value is ['.md', '.markdown', '.html', '.htm', '.txt', '.js', '.css']
#page_extensions: ["html", "htm", "md", "markdown"]

# Template and partial identifier is a regular expression that is used to identify the template
# and partial files in the site. The default value is /^_/, any filename that starts with an underscore.
# These files are processed, but not included in the output directory, local or release.
# This setting does not impact template paths below, which are used to share the site as a template,
# which will include the template and partial files, if the template_paths includes them.
#template_and_partial_identifier: /^_/

# if you want to share the site as a template site, specify which files and directories 
# are part of the template.
# When you create a new site, these files and directories will be copied to the new site
# If you don't specify template_paths, the site will not be shared as a template site and
# the geb release --with_template option will not work.
# Likewise, for other sites to use this site as a template, you must specify the template_paths.
# The site template files will be archived into geb-template.tar.gz file and put within
# the release directory.
# e.g. template_paths: ["assets", "shared", "*.html", "site.webmanifest"]
template_paths: ["assets", "shared", "*.html", "site.webmanifest"]

# Template message is a message that is displayed when the site is used as a template.
template_message: "Please remember to uncomment the site_variables section in the geb.config.yml file and update for your site. Some templates and partials use site_url, which needs to be aligned with the local_port configuration in the geb.config.yml file."

# If you want to specify site variables, you can do so here.  These variables will be available
# to the site as _{variable}_.  You can specify different variables for different environments.
# Site variables are processed last, and can be used in pages, templates or partials.
# To use a site variable, use the syntax _{variable_name}_.
# In the example below, use _{title}_ and _{site_url}_ in your pages, templates or partials.
# Geb will use local or release version depending if you are running the build or release command.
# Geb also sets several built-in variables that you can use in your site.
#  - _{site_name}_ - the name of the site
#  - _{page_relative_path}_ - the relative path of the page from the site directory
#  - _{page_title}_ - the title of the page, extracted from the page content <title> tag
site_variables:
  local:
    title: "My Local Site"
    site_url: "http://localhost:4000"
  release:
    title: "My Site"
    site_url: "https://example.com"
